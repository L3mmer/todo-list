# todo-list
My first JavaScript project.  It is still being worked on.
Must be familar with arrays to remove and toggle.  0 is for first item on todo list, 1 for second etc...
This is the most basic of a todo list so far.
Future Additions:
[] List will be customizable.  Getting rid of the edit delete and toggle buttons. Allowing the user to edit, mark and remove todos at the todo item itself.
[] Better styling.
